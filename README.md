# jQuery.slideMatrix


## Options

_itemSelector_

This is the selector of the item elements (slides) within the slideMatrix element.

> Note:
>   The item elements should be hidden by default with the following CSS: `display: none;`
>   The plugin will hide the items on initialization, but it is better to do this in the stylesheets.
